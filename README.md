# lite
lite is a web framework and orm written in ruby. 
This framework began as an attempt to combine the end result of two projects we teach at App Academy, Rails Lite and Active Record Lite.
Combining the two into a cohesive framework has been an edifying process, resulting in a full featured product with which one can interact much in the same way as with Ruby on Rails.
Features include:

1. Routing
2. Controller Base (inspired by ActionController)
3. Model Base (inspired by ActiveRecord::Base)
4. Database Migrations
5. Templating using ERB
6. Session based Authentication
7. Flash notifications
8. Serving public assets

Developing lite continues to be an enjoyable and instructive process. Upcoming features include...
1. More robust validations for ModelBase
2. Regex-free routes
3. PostgreSQL support
